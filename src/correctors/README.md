# Error correcting algorithms

## erasures.c

Error correcting algorithm for the binary erasure channel of a classical AES-128 key schedule. Begins by resolving all bits that can be deduced by the initial noisy key and then propagates. If it gets stuck, it begins a recursive exponential ennumeration. 

## alternative_bsc.c

Bruteforces all possible values of the initial row of an alternative key schedule as presented in the following article (see pages 7 and 8)

In particular all possible values of [$s_i$, $s_{i+1}$, $s_{i+2}, $s_{i+3}] for {i \in {0,1,2,3}} are enumerated and each candidate is ranked according to its Z-score

## heuristic_bsc.c 

Ennumerates key schedules using the algorithm presented in the following article using the Z-score as a heuristic of each candidate
