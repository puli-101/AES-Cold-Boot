# AES Key Reconstruction

## Overview

This repository contains generators, modifiers, and reconstructor for two different representations of AES key schedules. 

- The first folder named 'classical_representation' contains the above mention functionalities for standard AES key schedules. In particular, the possibility to expand a 128-bit key or generate a random AES-128 key schedule, simulate the passing of a key schedule through a binary channel, and correct a schedule that went through one of these channels. For further details see 'classic_representation/README.md'

- The second folder named 'alternative_representation' contains the same functionalities presented but for an alternative AES schedule. This new schedule is comprised of four linearly independent blocks of four bytes per round. For further details see 'alternative_representation/README.md' or the article below. The functionalities included in this folder also permit the translation of a standard key schedule to an alternative in order to correct it. 

## Credits

The alternative key schedule was inspired by the following article:

The original subject of this project was inspired by the key fixing algorithms on cold boot attacks. See:
