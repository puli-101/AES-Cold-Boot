## AES Key Reconstruction

This repository includes an AES key schedule generator from a given key as well as a random key schedule generator. Additionally, it includes an erasure and bit flipping functionality and an error correcting algorithm for the binary erasure channel. 

Improvements :
- In the core resolution cycle we can add a 4th case that includes the analysis of the first column
